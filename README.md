# To-Do List Web App

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to create tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input a task and add it to the list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed using checkboxes, which strike through the text.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list when they are checked as completed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the app interface, including background images and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Handling dynamic functionality such as adding, checking, and deleting tasks.

## How It Works

1. **Add Task**: Type a task in the input field and click **submit**.
2. **Mark Completed**: Check the checkbox to mark the task as completed. The text will be struck through.
3. **Delete Task**: Once a task is marked as completed, a delete button will appear to remove the task.
